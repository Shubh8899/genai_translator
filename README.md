## Description

I developed a NestJS app enabling text translation between two languages via Azure OpenAI's translator service. It streamlines language translation by leveraging NestJS's efficiency and Azure OpenAI's capabilities, facilitating seamless communication across linguistic boundaries with ease and precision.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
```
